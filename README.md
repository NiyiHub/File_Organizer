# File_Organizer
File organizer is a python script meant to organize files in a given directory.

# How it works
The process at which the automation is carried out includes; 
firstly, it fetches the directory at which it is been run from. 
Secondly, five different paths (‘Document Files’, ‘Picture Files’, ‘Music Files’, ‘Movie Files’ and ‘Others’) will be created, 
then with the use of format, each file will be moved to their corresponding paths.

# Prerequisite
Install python 3.9 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-396/)
Install an IDE (PyCharm is a good recommendation)
